This project supports a blog [article](https://enix.io/fr/blog/2018/12/deployer-kubernetes-1-13-sur-openstack-grace-a-terraform/) (in French) that I wrote in order to showcase an integrated usage of Terraform, OpenStack and kubernetes.

It heavily relies on a kubernetes Terraform module that I wrote for this specific purpose. On which a documentation is available [here](terraform/kubernetes/README.md).

Feel free to give feedback or ask questions !
